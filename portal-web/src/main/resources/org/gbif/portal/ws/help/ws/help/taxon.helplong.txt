1. SUMMARY

    The taxon web service provides access to records of taxon concepts from
    data resources in the GBIF network.
    
    This service can be used to find the species and higher taxa for which 
    GBIF has data.  The records returned represent the use of a scientific
    name in the context of one of the data resources included in the network,
    or the position assigned to the scientific name within a synthetic 
    taxonomic hierarchy maintained by the GBIF data portal.  This taxonomic 
    hierarchy is built from the taxonomic information provided by
    the individual resources and includes every a concept record for every
    name known to the portal.  The placement of any concept within the 
    hierarchy depends on an automated process and may not represent the 
    best current taxonomic opinion.
    
    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/<action>?<parameter_list>
            
      where:
      
        action is one of:
                    
          get - get a single taxon concept record
          list - search for taxon concept records matching a range of filters
          count - count taxon concept records matching a range of filters
          help - displays this help text
          schema - returns the response schema document
          stylesheet - returns a stylesheet for rendering response documents 
              as HTML
        
        parameter_list is a set of key-value pair options controlling or
        modifying how the service handles the action request.
    
    See subsections below for information on the parameters supported in parameter 
    list for each action.


2. GET INDIVIDUAL RECORDS - get

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/get/<key>?<parameter_list>
        or: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/get?<parameter_list>
    
      where:
      
        key is a numeric key uniquely identifying the taxon concept record within 
        the GBIF data portal.
    
        parameter_list is a set of URL-encoded key-value pairs including any of 
            the following keys:
            
          key - numeric key uniquely identifying the taxon concept record within 
              the GBIF data portal (same as key above).  Note that key strings of
              the form "c-1234" are generated by the portal to allow vernacular
              name records to be related to taxon concepts.  These vernacular
              name keys can also be resolved by this service.
              
          stylesheet - sets the URL of the stylesheet to be associated with the 
              response document.  This overrides the default provided by the data 
              portal.  Supplying an empty string as the value for this parameter
              disables the setting of a stylesheet by the data portal.  The value
              of this parameter is used in an xml-stylesheet processing instruction
              at the start of the response document.  See "7. BROWSER FORMATTING -
              stylesheet" below.
    
    The get action is intended as a quick way to retrieve an taxon record for
    which the key is already known (e.g. from an earlier use of the list action).
    
    The response is formatted according to the XML schema returned by the schema
    action (see "6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema" below) using the TaxonConcept
    element from the Taxon Concept Schema.
    
    The response may contain multiple TaxonConcept elements.  One of these will
    be marked with the primary="true" attribute and represents the taxon
    identified by the request.  The others will be marked with the primary="false"
    attribute and are included in the response as further information about the
    requested taxon.  The primary TaxonConcept includes a set of 
    RelationshipAssertion elements which identify the relationship between the
    primary taxon and these secondary taxa.  These relationships should be 
    interpreted as follows:
    
      1. Secondary taxa from the same data resource as the primary taxon - these
         relationships are provided by the data resource serving the information
         on the primary taxon.  (If the data resource is the synthetic "PORTAL"
         taxonomy, i.e. data resource 1, this simply means that these 
         relationships have been included in the classification generated 
         dynamically to manage data within the portal.)  The significance of the
         relationship is further defined by the value of the type attribute:
      
         - "IsParentTaxonOf" indicates that the primary taxon includes the
           secondary taxon as a taxon of immediately subordinate rank
         - "IsChildTaxonOf" indicates that the primary taxon is included by
           the secondary taxon as a taxon of immediately subordinate rank
         - "HasSynonym" indicates that the primary taxon is accepted as valid
           and the secondary taxon names are considered to be synonyms for the
           primary taxon name (including partial synonyms and misapplied names)
         - "IsIncludedIn" indicates that the primary taxon is not accepted as
           valid and the secondary taxon should be used instead
         - "HasVernacular" indicates that the secondary taxon is a vernacular
           name for the primary taxon
         - "IsVernacularFor" indicates that the primary taxon is a vernacular
           name for the secondary taxon
           
      2. Primary taxon from synthetic "PORTAL" taxonomy (i.e. data resource 1)
         and secondary taxon from a different resource - these relationships
         are managed by the portal to indicate how the synthetic classification
         used by the portal maps to the different taxon names used by each
         resource.  The type attribute in these cases is always "Includes".
         
      3. Secondary taxon from synthetic "PORTAL" taxonomy (i.e. data resource 1)
         and primary taxon from a different resource - these relationships 
         are managed by the portal to indicate how taxon names used in each
         resource are handled by the portal.  The type attribute in these cases
         is always "IsIncludedIn".
         
    Secondary taxa may also include TaxonRelationship elements of the type
    "IsChildTaxonOf" to indicate the full higher taxonomy for the primary
    taxon.
    
    Examples:
    
      __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/get/100
              - returns the taxon concept record with key 100
              
      __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/get?key=100&stylesheet=
              - returns the taxon concept record with key 100 with HTML formatting
                  disabled.    

    Likely future enhancements:
    
        1. Support a format parameter to switch to alternate formats.
        2. Include a URL to retrieve the original record from the provider.

  
3. SEARCH FOR RECORDS - list

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/list?<parameter_list>
    
      where:
      
        parameter_list is a set of URL-encoded key-value pairs including any of 
            the following keys:

          scientificname - return only records where the scientific name matches 
              that supplied.
              
              Including an asterisk '*' in the search string causes the service
              to return records for any name starting with the string preceding
              the asterisk.  There must be at least three characters preceding
              the asterisk.
                      
          rank - return only records where the rank matches that specified.  The
              value should be one of the following: kingdom, phylum, class, order,
              family, genus, species, infraspecific.
              
          dataproviderkey - return only records which have been made available by the
              provider identified by the supplied numeric key.  (Each provider may
              serve one or more resources, so this can be used to query the full
              set of resources from a single provider.)
              
              Values for dataproviderkey can be found through the provider web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/provider) or from previous invocations of
              the list and get actions of this service.
                      
          dataresourcekey - return only records which have been made available by the
              resource identified by the supplied numeric key.  (Each provider may
              serve one or more resources.)
              
              Values for dataresourcekey can be found through the resource web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/resource) or from previous invocations of
              the list and get actions of this service.
              
              The special value "PORTAL" can be used to retrieve just taxon concept
              records from the generated synthetic taxonomy maintained by the portal.
                      
          resourcenetworkkey - return only records which have been made available by 
              resources identified as belonging to the network identified by the supplied 
              numeric key.  (Each network may include several resources.)
              
              Values for resourcenetworkkey can be found through the network web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/network).
                      
          hostisocountrycode - return only records served by providers from the 
              country identified by the supplied 2-letter ISO code.
                      
          modifiedsince - return only records which have been indexed or modified
              in the GBIF data portal index on or after the supplied date (format
              YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2006-11-28).  Note that these dates are based on
              the time at the GBIF Secretariat in Copenhagen.
                      
          startindex - return the subset of the matching records that starts at
              the supplied (zero-based index).  If this is not supplied, the 
              response includes records starting with the first matching record
              (equivalent to startindex=0).  This can be used in conjunction with
              information in the /gbifResponse/header/summary element in the
              response document to manage paging through large sets of records.
                      
          maxresults - return at most the specified number of records.  The 
              default (and maximum supported) is 1000 records.  

          stylesheet - sets the URL of the stylesheet to be associated with the 
              response document.  This overrides the default provided by the data 
              portal.  Supplying an empty string as the value for this parameter
              disables the setting of a stylesheet by the data portal.  The value
              of this parameter is used in an xml-stylesheet processing instruction
              at the start of the response document.  See "7. BROWSER FORMATTING -
              stylesheet" below.
    
    The list action should be used to find taxon concept records of interest from
    within the GBIF data portal.  
    
    The response data are only sorted within an individual response.  If the search
    matches more records than can be returned in a single response, subsequent
    responses may include additional blocks of data for providers and resources 
    included in the earlier response.  The data from the union of all responses 
    may need to be sorted before use if such repetition is problematic.
    
    Note that this action does not count all records in the portal matching the 
    supplied filters.  The totalMatched attribute in the response should only
    be used to indicate whether further records exist.  To get an accurate 
    total count, us the count action (see "4. COUNT RECORDS - count" below).
    
    The response is formatted according to the XML schema returned by the schema
    action (see "6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema" below).
    
    The taxon concept records are found in the response document at the path
    /gbifResponse/dataProviders/dataProvider/dataResources/dataResource/taxonConcepts/taxonConcept
    
    The /gbifResponse/header/summary element may contain up to four attributes:
    
        start - the index of the first matching record returned.
        totalMatched - the minimum number of matching records contained in the portal.
            This should only be used to indicate that there are more records still
            unreturned.  Use the count action for an accurate count.  This value is
            only reliable if the startindex on the request was lower than the number
            of records actually matching.
        totalReturned - the number of records actually returned in this response.
        next - the index of the next matching record (if totalMatched is greater than
            totalReturned).  This can be used as the value for startindex on the next
            list request to retrieve another page of matching records.
            
    When there are more matching records to retrieve (i.e. the next attribute is set),
    the document includes a URL which can be used to retrieve the next page.  This is
    returned in the /gbifResponse/header/nextRequestUrl element.
    
    Examples:
    
      __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/list?scientificname=Puma+concolor
              - returns all TaxonConcept records for Puma concolor (i.e. one for every
                data resource including Puma concolor)

      __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/list?scientificname=Puma*&dataresourcekey=12
              - returns TaxonConcept records for names starting "Puma" and included
                in the data resource with the key value 12 in the GBIF portal

    Likely future enhancements:
    
        1. Support search by thematic network (e.g. MaNIS, OBIS, WFCC).
        2. Support multiple values for a single parameter (to be OR'ed together).
        3. Include URLs to perform the equivalent searches against each 
           matching provider.
        4. Support searches spanning 180 degrees east/west.


4. COUNT RECORDS - count

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/count?<parameter_list>
    
      where:
      
        parameter_list is a set of URL-encoded key-value pairs including any of 
            the following keys:

          scientificname - count only records where the scientific name matches 
              that supplied.
              
              Including an asterisk '*' in the search string causes the service
              to count records for any name starting with the string preceding
              the asterisk.  There must be at least three characters preceding
              the asterisk.
                      
          rank - count only records where the rank matches that specified.  The
              value should be one of the following: kingdom, phylum, class, order,
              family, genus, species, infraspecific.
              
          dataproviderkey - count only records which have been made available by the
              provider identified by the supplied numeric key.  (Each provider may
              serve one or more resources, so this can be used to query the full
              set of resources from a single provider.)
              
              Values for dataproviderkey can be found through the provider web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/provider) or from previous invocations of
              the list and get actions of this service.
                      
          dataresourcekey - count only records which have been made available by the
              resource identified by the supplied numeric key.  (Each provider may
              serve one or more resources.)
              
              Values for dataresourcekey can be found through the resource web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/resource) or from previous invocations of
              the list and get actions of this service.
              
              The special value "PORTAL" can be used to retrieve just taxon concept
              records from the generated synthetic taxonomy maintained by the portal.
                      
          resourcenetworkkey - count only records which have been made available by 
              resources identified as belonging to the network identified by the supplied 
              numeric key.  (Each network may include several resources.)
              
              Values for resourcenetworkkey can be found through the network web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/network).
                      
          hostisocountrycode - count only records served by providers from the 
              country identified by the supplied 2-letter ISO code.
                      
          modifiedsince - count only records which have been indexed or modified
              in the GBIF data portal index on or after the supplied date (format
              YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2006-11-28).  Note that these dates are based on
              the time at the GBIF Secretariat in Copenhagen.
    
          stylesheet - sets the URL of the stylesheet to be associated with the 
              response document.  This overrides the default provided by the data 
              portal.  Supplying an empty string as the value for this parameter
              disables the setting of a stylesheet by the data portal.  The value
              of this parameter is used in an xml-stylesheet processing instruction
              at the start of the response document.  See "7. BROWSER FORMATTING -
              stylesheet" below.
    
    The count action can be used to get an accurate count of taxon concept records of 
    interest from within the GBIF data portal prior to retrieving these records
    using the list action.  This may assist with deciding whether to refine the
    search more closely before retrieving records.
    
    The response is formatted according to the XML schema returned by the schema
    action (see "6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema" below).
    
    The count is returned in the totalMatched attribute of the 
    /gbifResponse/header/summary element in the response document.
    
    Examples:
    
      __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/count?scientificname=Puma+concolor
              - counts taxon concept records for the name Puma concolor

      __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/count?rank=family&dataresourcekey=12
              - counts family-level taxa in resource 12

    Likely future enhancements:
    
        1. Support multiple values for a single parameter (to be OR'ed together).


5. GET HELP - help

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/help
        or: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon
        
    The help action returns this help documentation.


6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/schema
        
    The schema action returns the XML schema document used for the responses to
    the get, list, count and help actions.
    
    The response document includes a header which includes intellectual property 
    statements, information on the request issued and a summary of the response 
    contents.  The body of the document for the response to a list or get action
    request is a dataProviders element, containing one or more dataProvider
    elements, each with metadata on a particular provider and a dataResources 
    element, containing one or more dataResource elements, each with metadata on 
    a particular resource and an taxonRecords element containing a set of 
    taxonRecord elements.

    The response data are only sorted within an individual response.  If the search
    matches more records than can be returned in a single response, subsequent
    responses may include additional blocks of data for providers and resources 
    included in the earlier response.  The data from the union of all responses 
    may need to be sorted before use if such repetition is problematic.
    

7. BROWSER FORMATTING - stylesheet

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/taxon/stylesheet
        
    The stylesheet action returns a simple XSLT document which can be used to display
    the responses to the get, list, count and help actions in a readable form in a 
    web browser.  An xml-stylesheet processing instruction referenceing this stylesheet
    is included by default in the responses to these actions.
