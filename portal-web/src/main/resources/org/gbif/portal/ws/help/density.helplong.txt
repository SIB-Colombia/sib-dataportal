1. SUMMARY

    The density web service provides access to records showing the density
    of occurrence records from the GBIF Network by one-degree cell.
    
    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/density/<action>?<parameter_list>
            
      where:
      
        action is one of:
                    
          list - search for density records matching a range of filters
          help - displays this help text
          schema - returns the response schema document
          stylesheet - returns a stylesheet for rendering response documents 
              as HTML
        
        parameter_list is a set of key-value pair options controlling or
        modifying how the service handles the action request.
    
    See subsections below for information on the parameters supported in parameter 
    list for each action.


2. SEARCH FOR RECORDS - list

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/density/list?<parameter_list>
    
      where:
      
        parameter_list is a set of URL-encoded key-value pairs including any of 
            the following keys:

          taxonconceptkey - return density records for the taxon identified
              by the supplied numeric key, including any records provided under 
              synonyms of the taxon concerned, and any records for child taxa (e.g.
              all genera and species within a family).  
              
              Values for taxonconceptkey can be found through the taxon web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/taxon).  Note that the service will always 
              search using the corresponding concept in the synthetic generated 
              "PORTAL" taxonomy (even if the taxonconceptkey is for a concept from
              a specific resource.  
              
          dataproviderkey - return density records for the provider identified by the 
              supplied numeric key.  (Each provider may serve one or more resources, 
              so this can be used to query the full set of resources from a single provider.)
              
              Values for dataproviderkey can be found through the provider web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/provider).
                      
          dataresourcekey - return density records for the resource identified by the 
              supplied numeric key.  (Each provider may serve one or more resources.)
              
              Values for dataresourcekey can be found through the resource web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/resource).
                      
          resourcenetworkkey - return density records for all resources identified as 
              belonging to the network identified by the supplied numeric key.  (Each 
              network may include several resources.)
              
              Values for resourcenetworkkey can be found through the network web service
              (see __WSROOT__/rest/network).
                      
          originisocountrycode - return density records for occurrences which occurred
              within the country identified by the supplied 2-letter ISO code.
                      
          format - specifies the format in which the records are to be returned.
              At present the supported values are brief and kml but more
              may be added later.  
              
              The brief format returns records with boundaries for each cell and a
              count of matching records.
              
              The kml format returns KML GroundOverlay for Google Earth,
              mapping an image to each cell.  The images use 6 colours to indicate
              the density of records (from yellow for 1-9 records up to red for
              100000 or more records).
                      
          stylesheet - sets the URL of the stylesheet to be associated with the 
              response document.  This overrides the default provided by the data 
              portal.  Supplying an empty string as the value for this parameter
              disables the setting of a stylesheet by the data portal.  The value
              of this parameter is used in an xml-stylesheet processing instruction
              at the start of the response document.  See "5. BROWSER FORMATTING -
              stylesheet" below.
    
    The list action should be used to find density records for a taxon, country,
    data provider, data resource or resource network.    

    Examples:
    
      __WSROOT__/rest/density/list?originisocountrycode=CA
              - returns density data for Canada

      __WSROOT__/rest/occurrence/list?dataresourcekey=12&format=kml
              - returns KML density layer for resource 12


3. GET HELP - help

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/density/help
        or: __WSROOT__/rest/density
        
    The help action returns this help documentation.


4. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/density/schema
        
    The schema action returns the XML schema document used for the responses to
    the list and help actions.
    
    The response document includes a header which includes intellectual property 
    statements, information on the request issued and a summary of the response 
    contents.  The body of the document for the response to a list or get action
    request is a dataProviders element, containing one or more dataProvider
    elements, each with metadata on a particular provider and a dataResources 
    element, containing one or more dataResource elements, each with metadata on 
    a particular resource and an occurrenceRecords element containing a set of 
    occurrenceRecord elements.
    

5. BROWSER FORMATTING - stylesheet

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/density/stylesheet
        
    The stylesheet action returns a simple XSLT document which can be used to 
    display the responses to the list and help actions in a readable form in a 
    web browser.  An xml-stylesheet processing instruction referenceing this 
    stylesheet is included by default in the responses to these actions.
