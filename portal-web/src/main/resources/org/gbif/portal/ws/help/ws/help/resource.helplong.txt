1. SUMMARY

    The resource web service provides access to records describing the 
    data resources in the GBIF network.
    
    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/<action>?<parameter_list>
            
      where:
      
        action is one of:
                    
          get - get a single resource record
          list - search for resource records matching a range of filters
          count - count resource records matching a range of filters
          help - displays this help text
          schema - returns the response schema document
          stylesheet - returns a stylesheet for rendering response documents 
              as HTML
        
        parameter_list is a set of key-value pair options controlling or
        modifying how the service handles the action request.
    
    See subsections below for information on the parameters supported in parameter 
    list for each action.


2. GET INDIVIDUAL RECORDS - get

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/get/<key>?<parameter_list>
        or: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/get?<parameter_list>
    
      where:
      
        key is a numeric key uniquely identifying the resource record within the
            GBIF data portal.
    
        parameter_list is a set of URL-encoded key-value pairs including any of 
            the following keys:
            
          key - numeric key uniquely identifying the resource record within the
              GBIF data portal (same as key above)
              
          stylesheet - sets the URL of the stylesheet to be associated with the 
              response document.  This overrides the default provided by the data 
              portal.  Supplying an empty string as the value for this parameter
              disables the setting of a stylesheet by the data portal.  The value
              of this parameter is used in an xml-stylesheet processing instruction
              at the start of the response document.  See "7. BROWSER FORMATTING -
              stylesheet" below.
    
    The get action is intended as a quick way to retrieve a resource record for
    which the key is already known (e.g. from an earlier use of the list action).
    
    The response is formatted according to the XML schema returned by the schema
    action (see "6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema" below).  The taxonConcepts element
    contains the taxon concepts of the highest rank found in the resource and can
    be used to start exploring the resource's taxonomy through the taxon web 
    service.
    
    Examples:
    
      __WSROOT__/rest/resource/get/100
              - returns the resource record with key 100
              
      __WSROOT__/rest/resource/get?key=100&stylesheet=
              - returns the resource record with key 100 with HTML formatting
                  disabled.    

  
3. SEARCH FOR RECORDS - list

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/list?<parameter_list>
    
      where:
      
        parameter_list is a set of URL-encoded key-value pairs including any of 
            the following keys:

          name - return only resources with names starting with the supplied 
              string.
                      
          providerkey - return only resources served by the provider identified
              by the supplied key.  Values for this key may be retrieved via
              previous calls to the provider, resource or occurrence web 
              services.
                      
          basisofrecordcode - return only resources which are identified as
          	  serving data with the identified basis of record.  Note that this only
          	  checks the default basis of record for the resource.
                      
              Supported values are: specimen, observation, living, germplasm, fossil,
              unknown.
                      
          modifiedsince - return only records which have been indexed or modified
              in the GBIF data portal index on or after the supplied date (format
              YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2006-11-28).  Note that these dates are based on
              the time at the GBIF Secretariat in Copenhagen.
                      
          startindex - return the subset of the matching records that starts at
              the supplied (zero-based index).  If this is not supplied, the 
              response includes records starting with the first matching record
              (equivalent to startindex=0).  This can be used in conjunction with
              information in the /gbifResults/header/summary element in the
              response document to manage paging through large sets of records.
                      
          maxresults - return at most the specified number of records.  The 
              default (and maximum supported) is 1000 records.  

          stylesheet - sets the URL of the stylesheet to be associated with the 
              response document.  This overrides the default provided by the data 
              portal.  Supplying an empty string as the value for this parameter
              disables the setting of a stylesheet by the data portal.  The value
              of this parameter is used in an xml-stylesheet processing instruction
              at the start of the response document.  See "7. BROWSER FORMATTING -
              stylesheet" below.
    
    The list action should be used to find resource records of interest from
    within the GBIF data portal.  
    
    Note that this action does not count all records in the portal matching the 
    supplied filters.  The totalMatched attribute in the response should only
    be used to indicate whether further records exist.  To get an accurate 
    total count, us the count action (see "4. COUNT RECORDS - count" below).
    
    The response is formatted according to the XML schema returned by the schema
    action (see "6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema" below.
    
    The resource records are found in the response document at the path
    /gbifResponse/dataProvider/dataProvider
    
    The /gbifResponse/header/summary element may contain up to four attributes:
    
        start - the index of the first matching record returned.
        totalMatched - the minimum number of matching records contained in the portal.
            This should only be used to indicate that there are more records still
            unreturned.  Use the count action for an accurate count.  This value is
            only reliable if the startindex on the request was lower than the number
            of records actually matching.
        totalReturned - the number of records actually returned in this response.
        next - the index of the next matching record (if totalMatched is greater than
            totalReturned).  This can be used as the value for startindex on the next
            list request to retrieve another page of matching records.
            
    When there are more matching records to retrieve (i.e. the next attribute is set),
    the document includes a URL which can be used to retrieve the next page.  This is
    returned in the /gbifResponse/header/nextRequestUrl element.
    
    Examples:
    
      __WSROOT__/rest/resource/list?name=Can
              - returns records for resources with names beginning with the string 
                "Can"

      __WSROOT__/rest/resource/list?basisofrecordcode=germplasm
              - returns records for resources containing germplasm data.

    Likely future enhancements:
    
        1. Support multiple values for a single parameter (to be OR'ed together).


4. COUNT RECORDS - count

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/count?<parameter_list>
    
      where:
      
        parameter_list is a set of URL-encoded key-value pairs including any of 
            the following keys:

          name - count only resources with names starting with the supplied 
              string.
                      
          providerkey - count only resources served by the provider identified
              by the supplied key.  Values for this key may be retrieved via
              previous calls to the provider, resource or occurrence web 
              services.
                      
          basisofrecordcode - count only resources which are identified as
          	  serving data with the identified basis of record.  Note that this only
          	  checks the default basis of record for the resource.
                      
              Supported values are: specimen, observation, living, germplasm, fossil,
              unknown.
                      
          modifiedsince - count only records which have been indexed or modified
              in the GBIF data portal index on or after the supplied date (format
              YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2006-11-28).  Note that these dates are based on
              the time at the GBIF Secretariat in Copenhagen.
                      
          stylesheet - sets the URL of the stylesheet to be associated with the 
              response document.  This overrides the default provided by the data 
              portal.  Supplying an empty string as the value for this parameter
              disables the setting of a stylesheet by the data portal.  The value
              of this parameter is used in an xml-stylesheet processing instruction
              at the start of the response document.  See "7. BROWSER FORMATTING -
              stylesheet" below.
    
    The count action can be used to get an accurate count of resource records of 
    interest from within the GBIF data portal prior to retrieving these records
    using the list action.  This may assist with deciding whether to refine the
    search more closely before retrieving records.
    
    The response is formatted according to the XML schema returned by the schema
    action (see "6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema" below).
    
    The count is returned in the totalMatched attribute of the 
    /gbifResponse/header/summary element in the response document.
    
    Examples:
    
      __WSROOT__/rest/resource/count?providerkey=8
              - counts resources served by provider 8

    Likely future enhancements:
    
        1. Support multiple values for a single parameter (to be OR'ed together).


5. GET HELP - help

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/help
        or: __WSROOT__/rest/resource
        
    The help action returns this help documentation.


6. RESPONSE STRUCTURE - schema

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/schema
        
    The schema action returns the XML schema document used for the responses to
    the get, list, count and help actions.
    
    The response document includes a header which includes intellectual property 
    statements, information on the request issued and a summary of the response 
    contents.  The body of the document for the response to a list or get action
    request is a dataProviders element, containing one or more dataProvider
    elements, each with metadata on a particular provider and a dataResources 
    element, containing one or more dataResource elements, each with metadata on 
    a particular resource.  In responses to the get action, the taxonConcepts 
    element contains the taxon concepts of the highest rank found in the resource 
    and can be used to start exploring the resource's taxonomy through the taxon
    web service.


7. BROWSER FORMATTING - stylesheet

    Syntax: __WSROOT__/rest/resource/stylesheet
        
    The stylesheet action returns a simple XSLT document which can be used to display
    the responses to the get, list, count and help actions in a readable form in a 
    web browser.  An xml-stylesheet processing instruction referenceing this stylesheet
    is included by default in the responses to these actions.
